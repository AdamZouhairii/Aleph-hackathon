# Decentralized Dataset Web App using Aleph.im 🌐

## Overview ℹ️
This project aims to create a decentralized web application leveraging Aleph.im for data storage and management. The application facilitates  the marketplace for datasets and LLM (Large Language Model) models. It also provides functionalities for managing user databases and datasets, as well as enabling users to run their own models in a runtime environment.

## Features 🚀
1. **Decentralized Storage:** Utilizes Aleph.im for decentralized storage of datasets and models, ensuring data integrity and availability.
2. **Marketplace Creation:** Allows users to create and browse a marketplace for datasets and LLM models, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing.
3. **User Database Management:** Provides tools for users to manage their databases efficiently, including CRUD operations and access control.
4. **Dataset Management:** Enables users to upload, download, and manage datasets seamlessly within the application.
5. **Model Runtime Environment:** Offers a runtime environment where users can execute their own LLM models, leveraging the computing power of the platform.

## Technologies Used 💻
- **Aleph.im:** Decentralized storage solution for datasets and models.
- **Python:** Backend development and model execution.
- **TensorFlow:** Framework for training and executing machine learning models.
- **Linux:** Operating system for hosting the web application and managing server-side operations.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Frontend development for creating an intuitive user interface.
- **Flask:** Web framework for Python, used for building the backend of the application.
- **SQLite:** Lightweight relational database management system for user and metadata storage.

## Setup Instructions 🛠️
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using pip.
3. Set up Aleph.im credentials for decentralized storage.
4. Configure the database and establish user authentication mechanisms.
5. Run the Flask application and ensure all endpoints are functional.
6. Deploy the application to a web server for public access.

## Usage 📋
1. Register/Login: Blockchain.
2. Marketplace: Browse available datasets and models in the marketplace or create your own listings.
3. Dataset Management: Upload, download, and manage datasets in your personal storage space.
4. Model Execution: Utilize the runtime environment to execute your own LLM models on provided datasets.
5. Database Management: Manage your user database, including CRUD operations and access control settings.
